PROJECT TITLE: MURDERS! 

DESCRIPTION: 
This project deals with displaying and analyzing over 600,000 lines of real data about the murders committed in the United States ranging from years 1982 to 2014. Each piece of data was modified and organized using python to be grouped into various JSON files which represent different and interesting trends. These trends vary from describing the perpetratorâ€™s race to the number of weapons used in the murders by each race and sex. Utilizing HTML , CSS, and JS, these trends were then represented in bar graphs and other complex graphs on a detailed and styled website hosted on Github. 

GETTING STARTING: 
These instructions below will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

PREREQUISITES: 
Python (Version 3): import pandas and import Collections
Java Script: d3.js version 5 and canvas.js 
HTML5 
CSS3 

RUNNING: 
No need for installations. Use this url: https://bnding.github.io to access the website. 

FRAMEWORKS USED AND BUILT WITH: 
d3.js - This web framework was utilized for the regular bar and line graphs. 
canvas.js - This web framework was utilized for the stacked bar graphs

FILES/REPOSITORY:
We used Github to host our website and manage all the files of our website.. URL access to public repository on GitHub: https://github.com/bnding/bnding.github.io. 
CSS folder: bootstrap.min.css and style.css
Datasets folder: contains all JSON files of processed data done by processData.py
Images folder: image used for home page
JS folder: contains all JavaScript code for website: bootstrap, jquery, canvas, and website code 
Index.html (main page), page1, 2, 3, and 4 .html files are the different pages for the website pertaining to the trends
processData.py: Python code used to create each and every JSON file in Dataset folder. Contains all the data processing

FRONT END:
The programming languages used for the front end were HTML and CSS. Front end basically deals with the styling and formatting of the website with objects, such as images, graphs, text, and other objects.

BACK END:
Python and JavaScript were utilized for the back end, which included manipulating data in JSON files and setting up the framework for the website and displaying different objects on the website. For example, for the bar graphs, we used d3.js to create the general framework and then utilized HTML and CSS to add text and formatting to our liking.
