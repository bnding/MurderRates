			<p>This bar graph depicts the numbers of crimes committed in the United States per month.
				In general, the frequency of murders for all the twelve months seems to be approximately the same.
				However, according to this representation, July is the month with the highest crimes committed
				followed closely by August.
				It can also be implied that murders are more likely to be committed during the Summer than any other
				season.</p>

			<p>This bar graph represents the amount of murders committed based on the perpetrator's race.
				The races we have included based on the data set are Native American/Alaskan, White, Black, unknown,
				and Asian/Pacific Islander.
				The race with the top number of crimes is white and following closely behind is the black race and
				unknown.
				These two races reach approximately 200,000 crimes. Surprisingly, all the other races are very low
				(almost less than 2,000)
				compared to these two.</p>

			<p>This bar graph depicts the frequency of crimes committed by perpetrators based on their ages.
				It shows how crimes were committed more during the early twenties and then gradually started
				decreasing.
				The maximum number of crimes is committed by perpetrators of age 20. This graph also depicts a bell
				curve
				where it peaks at age 20 and gradually decreases as the age increases.</p>
